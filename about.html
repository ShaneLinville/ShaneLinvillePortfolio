            After graduating high school in 2003 I was unsure of what my next steps were. I didn't go to college, but
            instead I went to work for Hallmark Cards here in Kansas City. In 2009, after a series of life events, I started
            my journey to pursuing my associates degree.
        </p>

        <p>
            After 10 years in the distribution center I landed my first job at headquarters working in the data management
            organization. There I realized that I wanted to learn how to program software. I was very interested in how the
            systems worked and really wanted to understand the backend.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2017 I completed my associates in computer science from the Metropolitan Community College of Kansas City. It
            took several years as I married a beautifal wife and began to have a family. Without their support I was able to
            complete my degree.
        </p>

        <p>
            My family consists of my wife and me and our 3 boys ranging from the ages of 12 to 1. We love music, art, and spending
            time at waterparks and playing sports.
